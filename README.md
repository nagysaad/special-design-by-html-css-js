Interactive Responsive Website with Advanced JavaScript Customizations

This project is a fully responsive e-commerce website built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript, offering a highly interactive user experience with various customization options. The project incorporates advanced JavaScript features like Local Storage, DOM manipulation, BOM manipulation, and dynamic user interface controls.

Key Features:

Responsive Design: The website adapts to different screen sizes (desktop, tablet, and mobile) using media queries, providing a seamless browsing experience across devices.
JavaScript Functionality:
Customization Options: Users can change the store's background image and theme color dynamically, allowing for a personalized experience.
Toggle Sidebar Icons: Users have the option to show or hide the sidebar icons, which point to different store sections, giving them control over the layout.
Local Storage: Preferences like background image, theme color, and sidebar visibility are saved using Local Storage, ensuring persistence across sessions.
Event Handling & DOM Manipulation: Implemented interactive elements such as buttons and forms that update the UI in real-time based on user actions.
BOM (Browser Object Model): Used BOM to control browser navigation, manage the URL, and interact with the browser environment.
Clean and Semantic HTML5 Structure: Ensured code readability, accessibility, and SEO optimization through semantic HTML.
Modern CSS Styling: Styled with CSS3, using Flexbox and Grid for a well-organized, responsive layout.
Cross-browser Compatibility: The website is tested and optimized for performance across different browsers.
This project showcases my ability to create dynamic and customizable user interfaces using pure JavaScript, along with a strong focus on responsive design and browser integration.
