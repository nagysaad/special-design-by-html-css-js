Responsive Website with Advanced JavaScript Features

This is a fully responsive website built using HTML5, CSS3, and JavaScript to create a dynamic and interactive user experience. The project integrates advanced JavaScript features such as Local Storage, DOM manipulation, events, and Browser Object Model (BOM) manipulation to enhance functionality.

Key Features:

**Responsive Design: The website is fully responsive, using media queries to adapt to different screen sizes across devices (desktop, tablet, and mobile).
JavaScript Enhancements:
**Local Storage: Implemented local storage to store user preferences and data across sessions, ensuring a personalized experience.
**Event Handling: Used JavaScript event listeners to create interactive elements such as forms, buttons, and dynamic UI updates based on user input.
**DOM Manipulation: Dynamically updated page content and elements in real-time using JavaScript for a more engaging user experience.
**BOM (Browser Object Model): Utilized BOM features like managing browser windows, interacting with the browser history, and manipulating the page URL for enhanced navigation and control over the browsing environment.
**Clean HTML5 and CSS3: Semantic HTML and modern CSS techniques (Flexbox, Grid) to build a structured and visually appealing interface.
**Cross-browser Compatibility: Ensured consistent performance and appearance across various web browsers.
This project highlights my ability to create feature-rich, responsive web applications by leveraging JavaScript to handle both front-end interactivity and browser-level functionality.
